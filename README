Blue Balls Inc.
-------------

A simple puzzle game created for SA Gamedev VII.

Created using Python with Bottle for the server side, and HTML and Javascript with jQuery on the client side.

By the final version I plan to support:

* Tutorial
* Randomly generated levels
* High scores
* Custom level creation
* Custom machine part creation

The latest build of the game can be viewed at http://blueballs.jscott.me/ and information about it at http://jscott.me/blueballs.html
